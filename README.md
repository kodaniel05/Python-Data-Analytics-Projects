## Python Data Analytics Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects I worked on during my first couple of years at Purdue University.
The goal of these notebooks was to learn and practice core Python functions commonly used in data analytics, visualization, and web scraping.

Each file is a mini project, focusing on a different concept or library. These are not polished, large-scale projects‚Äîrather, they are snapshots of my learning journey as I built confidence working with Python in real-world data contexts.

üöÄ Purpose

To demonstrate my hands-on learning with Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Polars, Matplotlib, GeoPandas, BeautifulSoup).

To show a breadth of topics I explored while learning analytics, data cleaning, visualization, and automation.

To serve as a reference collection for myself and others who are beginning their journey in Python data analytics.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note

These are mini projects for learning purposes.
They are not optimized for production, but they reflect my progression and curiosity as I developed as a data analytics student.
